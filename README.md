# `minesweeper-model`

This package is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper game</a> without a frontend. In other words, it only offers a Minesweeper model and an interface to access and modify the board or "play" the game programmatically. As a result, this package is not meant to be a Minesweeper game playable by an end user.

This package is mostly meant for people who develop Minesweeper solvers. Anyone developing such a solver can use this package to skip the step of developing a Minesweeper model to test their solver on and start working on the solver itself straightaway.
